# RIPNFT

Fun donation wallet project to try the ERC1155.

Creators can start events and accept donations for a set period of time, 
on the event end the creator and the supporters can mint an NFT for the 
collection corresponding to the event.

Maybe the implementation of the donation being received directly to the contract is wanky but I wanted to test the IERC1155Receiver.
No safeMath implemented.
In this implementation the deployer takes 3% cut.
